# OTF-IoT
A prototypical approach for on-the-fly programming IoT end devices over the cloud for large scale deployments

On-the-fly programming is a style of programming in which the programmer augments and modifies the program while it is running, without stopping or restarting, in order to assert expressive, programmable control at run-time. Because of the fundamental powers of programming languages, we believe the technical and aesthetic aspects of on-the-fly programming are worth exploring.

In this project, we present a prototypical approach for on-the-fly programming, based on the cloud with IoT end devices, which supports a truly concurrent programming model.

Using the features and properties of this project, solutions to many IoT issues of the future can be addressed.
